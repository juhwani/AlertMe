# What is this project?

This project aims to help drivers stay alert in traffic. Raspberry PI 5 will be the base along with different modules for it including Camera, Speaker, and AI chip(if needed). Camera will detect traffic light leveraging CV and speaker will sound when traffic light has changed.
<br>
</br>
# MVP?

When the traffic light turns green, the speaker will emit a small beep sound, letting the driver know that the signal has changed.
<br>
</br>
# What are the nice to haves?

Solving edge cases
Detect whether the driver is in traffic or not.
Recognize red light with view obstructed.
<br>
</br>
# When will the project be complete?

Hopefully before December. The project will be complete when all of MVP and nice to haves have been completed.

# Priority Project Management
### **Project Component Components and Phases**
- Set up Raspberry PI with camera and speaker
- Research into CV models tailored to traffic lights
- Create algorithm to determine Red Light -> Green Light
- Connect alogorithm to camera and speaker
- Test Drive
- Revisions and test Cycle
<br>
</br>

## PHASE RN: 
## **Set up Raspberry PI with camera and speaker**
<br>


### TODO
- Research CV tailored to Traffic lights
- Research if I need AI CHIP
### DOING
- Getting Raspberry PI and physical components
### DONE
### BUGS / NOT SURE HOW TO DO
